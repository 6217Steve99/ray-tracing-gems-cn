abstract = "This paper presents ray casting as the methodological basis for a CAD/CAM solid modeling system. Solid objects are modeled by combining primitive solids, such as blocks and cylinders, using the set operators union, intersection, and difference. To visualize and analyze the composite solids modeled, virtual light rays are cast as probes. By virtue of its simplicity, ray casting is reliable and extensible. The most difficult mathematical problem is finding line-surface intersection points. So surfaces such as planes, quadrics, tori, and probably even parametric surface patches may bound the primitive solids. The adequacy and efficiency of ray casting are issues addressed here. A fast picture generation capability for interactive modeling is the biggest challenge. New methods are presented, accompanied by sample pictures and CPU times, to meet the challenge."

abstract="Most of the research on the global illumination problem in computer graphics has been concentrated on finite-element (radiosity) techniques. Monte Carlo methods are an intriguing alternative which are attractive for their ability to handle very general scene descriptions without the need for meshing. In this paper we study techniques for reducing the sampling noise inherent in pure Monte Carlo approaches to global illumination. Every light energy transport path from a light source to the eye can be generated in a number of different ways, according to how we partition the path into an initial portion traced from a light source, and a final portion traced from the eye. Each partitioning gives us a different unbiased estimator, but some partitionings give estimators with much lower variance than others. We give examples of this phenomenon and describe its significance. We also present work in progress on the problem of combining these multiple estimators to achieve near-optimal variance, with the goal of producing images with less noise for a given number of samples.",
